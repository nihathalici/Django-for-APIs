# Django for APIs
This is my repo following the book "Django for APIs" by William S. Vincent.

"If you’re looking for a guide into the world of Django, then the three-step of Django for Beginners, Django for APIs, and Django for Professionals is ideal. Will’s books are an awesome companion."—CARLTON GIBSON, Django Fellow and Django REST Framework core contributor
